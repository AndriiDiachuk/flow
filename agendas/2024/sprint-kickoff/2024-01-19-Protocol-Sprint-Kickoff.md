# Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

- Very quick turnaround on migration gaps needed for v2 token standards - in ~1week we came up with a clear plan on what needs to be added in Cadence migrations to support the updated v2 token standards (targetting next week to close the discussion and approve the standards).

#### Incidents
- 4 incidents on the public access nodes occurred on 1/12 (Friday)
  - Root cause for two of them were the APAC region public AN nodes/edge being slow
  - Still investigating the other two.
