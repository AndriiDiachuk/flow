# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards

### **Governance and Tokenomics** \[Kshitij]
Cycle Objective(s): Transaction fees on EVM, increasing transaction fees and inflation reduction plan.

**Done last sprint**
- Forum post regarding proposals on EVM gas and transaction fee reviewed, published, and shared on Discord. Working groups were briefed to disseminate details of the proposed changes to the community in upcoming meetings. See the post [here](https://forum.flow.com/t/proposing-transaction-fee-changes-and-flow-evm-gas-charges-for-flow-crescendo-launch/5817)
- Modeled inflation reduction options including the impact on validator incentives. Discussed pros and cons with Dete; additional research is needed on new potential options that surfaced aimed at minimizing impact on validators, token holders, and network security. See deck [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1EBYqB8FwxHtOwaQMHiId0ZZv4bRNThNYrgF5-CZeI8M/edit?pli=1#slide=id.g26c5efcb5cb_0_280)
- Impact of transaction fee increase on partner costs was assessed by pulling latest data for top 20 transaction payers on Flow. Discussions held with BD/partnership team, and the timeline for partner outreach is set for mid-May. See research [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PPxxAotsIYLzydAnuBAgQe1BmEcamiuSQUmsDtrpaKs/edit#gid=1414811201)
- Working Groups convened to address challenges related to hosting working groups, particularly the formalization of WGs that have transitioned them into more structured townhall-style meetings rather than informal participatory sessions where tangible work was accomplished. Going forward, WGs wouldn't overtly concern themselves with formalization and structures except keeping GitHub pages updated after meetings
- Monthly Governance Working Group meeting was convened - Governance OKR updates were shared along with current status of FLIPs; also invited new community operators to set up consensus nodes (to maintain decentralization)

**This sprint**

- For decentralization efforts, work with a16z to consolidate three nodes, and with Coinbase to reduce one node they operate on leased stake
- Automation of decentralization dashboard to send messages when critical thresholds are crossed
- Gather and respond to community feedback on the forum post
- Draft FLIP on EVM gas to compute ratio and compute limit hike
- Update FLIP on transaction fee to suggest a transaction fee multiplier closely tied to FLOW token's market price
- Continue research on Inflation (new strategies, other networks, validator impact, etc.) and sync with Dete again
