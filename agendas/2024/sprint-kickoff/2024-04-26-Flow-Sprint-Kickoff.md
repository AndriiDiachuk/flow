# Overview


### Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

- First TN state migrated with both Atree inlining and C1.0 bootstrapped on Migration Testnet & passed Epoch transition. Atree inlining reduced the EN memory usage from ~280GB to 132GB - 54% reduction in memory usage! [Jan]
- Cross-VM bridge is code complete (save for more testing) and also deployed to PreviewNet! Contract audit starts next Monday! [Greg]

# Working Group Updates

### **Cadence and Virtual Machine** \[Jan]
Cycle Objective(s):

1) Upgrade Mainnet to Crescendo Release with minimal impact on developers, to lower the barrier for cross chain liquidity on Flow
2) Calibrate Transaction fees so that they accurately reflect resource usage during execution and deploy as part of Crescendo to avoid future disruption.
3) Analyze execution runtime trends and risks to plan next set of scalability OKRs.

* Stretch-goals:
4) Expand testing capability of storehouse so that we can validate execution correctness and benchmark performance on Mainnet data
5) Design a new Trie to improve performance of update operation, reduce memory usage and size of proofs and to support more flexible proof queries.
6) Enable Concurrent Execution on one EN on Mainnet to validate correctness of the implementation (Detect execution forks)
7) Improve execution performance to mitigate the impact of adding metadata to token standards
