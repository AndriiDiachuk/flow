**This sprint**

- Continue Atree register inlining:
  https://github.com/onflow/atree/issues/292
- Complete data collection of script execution on RN
- Storehouse design (execution state on disk)

**On Hold**

- Plan removal of concurrent storage bottlenecks
    - Transaction fee deduction
    - [Cadence Type checker is not reentrant](https://dapperlabs.slack.com/archives/CG0B7CJAJ/p1684434997197079) (type comparison depends on consistent pointer used by programs cache, program cache needs to always return the same pointer to the same type)
