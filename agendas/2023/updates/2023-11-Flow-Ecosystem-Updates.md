### Tooling, infrastructure and other software for builders
1. [Contract Browser](https://contractbrowser.com/blog/introducing-v2) V2 launched which makes discovering, interacting and viewing smart contracts seamless as well as massively supporting composability. 

### Protocol, core contracts and node updates

### Cadence and smart contract updates
1. Hosted community Smart Contract engineering open houses that collaborated with the ecosystem to finalize designs and plans for the Hybrid custody smart contract standard and the V2 token standards.
2. [FLIP 179](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/179) covering scheduled contract updates was approved and will be used for Cadence 1.0 migrations
Randomness made its way to Mainnet with indefinite random source history running on [RandomBeaconHistory].

### Innovation, composability and advanced concepts

### Mainnet, Network upgrade
The Nov 8th mainnet network upgrade includes several important updates.
1. Node software updates which make the network more resilient against message propagation attacks.
2. Updates to the access node API to simplify dApp architecture by making it easy to consume transaction events.
3. Enabling script execution on the access nodes.
4. Tamper-proof, verifiable, unpredictable and efficient on-chain random generator for Cadence contracts.

## Grant project updates

Articles and Content - [Fullstackpho](https://github.com/ph0ph0) wrote an articles on [Flow Node types](https://fullstackpho.com/types-of-node-on-flow-blockchain) as well as created a [guide and starter project](https://fullstackpho.com/how-to-use-shell-scripts-to-speed-up-cadence-development-on-flow-blockchain) for using shell scripts to super charge Cadence development and testing.

Overhauled Cookbook - The Cadence Cookbook got a major overhaul led by [Lea](lealobanov (Lea Lobanov)) with a brand new modern UI, better process for community members creating their own recipies and integrated tests.

## Community updates 
1. Affiliated Accounts project by [Giovanni](https://github.com/sisyphusSmiling), an early beta app which links one's ETH account to their Flow account using [ETH signatures + validation](https://contractbrowser.com/A.f3c8bba150be9074.ETHAffiliatedAccounts).
