### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (10/3 to 10/16)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalization | 99.9%  |    100%       |       0%          |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.781%    |       219%        |

#### Incidents
- 15 Consensus nodes run by an operator were reset to the start of the spork and fell behind.
  - Flow mainnet is now in the Epoch fallback mode.
- Public access nodes became inaccessible due to a DNS change by the operator.

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*
