### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (8/18 to 9/1)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalizatoin | 99.9%  |    99.985%    |       14.9%       |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.975%    |       24.8%       |

| Access API Liveness     | 99.9%  |    99.97%     |       29.8%       |

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*

### **Performance Pod Sprint Objective - Jan B**

**Done last sprint**

Atree Register Inlining
- Continue updating atree design, implementing atree inlining, and adding tests

Execution Disk space growth mitigation
- Deployed v0.31.15 to mainnet ENs
- It slows the data disk growth by 85% by periodically pruning the chunk data pack folder.

Storehouse
- [Design doc published ](https://dapperlabs.notion.site/Storehouse-Design-Whiteboard-2f38e27891fc4e3e91415dbce240f175)
- Milestones created, started implementing storehouse [for the first milestone ](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/4682)

Other fixes
- [Fix verification cadende runtime settings](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/4676)
- [Pass zerolog by value](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/4644)

**This sprint**

- [Continue Atree register inlining](https://github.com/onflow/atree/issues/292)

**On Hold**

- Plan removal of concurrent storage bottlenecks
    - Transaction fee deduction
    - [Cadence Type checker is not reentrant](https://dapperlabs.slack.com/archives/CG0B7CJAJ/p1684434997197079) (type comparison depends on consistent pointer used by programs cache, program cache needs to always return the same pointer to the same type)
- [Execution stack refactor - clear separation of ingestion engine and block computer](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/4077)
- [Automated Performance Tests](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/3548)
