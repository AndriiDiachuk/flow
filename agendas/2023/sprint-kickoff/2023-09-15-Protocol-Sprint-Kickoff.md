### **Performance Pod Sprint Objective - Jan B**

**Done last sprint**

Atree Register Inlining
- Continue updating atree design, implementing atree inlining, and adding tests

Execution Disk space growth mitigation
- Deployed v0.31.15 to mainnet ENs
- It slows the data disk growth by 85% by periodically pruning the chunk data pack folder.
