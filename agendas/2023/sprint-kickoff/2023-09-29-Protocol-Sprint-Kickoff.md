### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (9/1 to 9/14)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalization | 99.9%  |    99.921%    |       79.4%       |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.921%    |       79.4%       |
| Transaction Execution   | 99.9%  |    99.916%    |       84.3%       |
| Block Sealing           | 99.9%  |    99.921%    |       79.4%       |
| Access API Liveness     | 99.9%  |    99.545%    |       455%        |

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*

- Sev-2 Incident: Public Access nodes went down between 5:20 pm to 6:00 pm on Wednesday 9/13
     - Root cause: ANs were not started after a hardware upgrade by the AN operator
     - Fix: Auto-restart has since been added; More observability on the ANs will be added soon.
