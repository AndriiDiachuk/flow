# Team Wins ðŸŽ‰
- Since August, through network scaledowns/deprecation, snapshot cleanup, and node cleanup, we have reduced our infra bill by $25k a month.

- Metrika has built a [new dashboard](https://app.metrika.co/flow/dashboard/slas?tr=YTD) specifically for network SLAs.

### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (9/14 to 9/29)

#### Incidents
- Scheduled downtime: Height coordinated upgrade on 9/19 that took ~13 mins

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*
