### **Performance Pod Sprint Objective - Jan B**

**Done last sprint**

Storehouse M1
- [Fix getting highest executed block ID when storehouse is enabled](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5109)
- [Fix storage snapshot](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5107)
- [Optimize finalized reader to cache last finalized height](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5056)
- [Adding flag to enable storehouse](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5054)
- [Optimization: Reduce finalized block call](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5053)

EVM
- [Events emitted from EVM are not encoded as other FVM events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5079)
  - [Emit events as Cadence events](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5090)
- [Add a transaction test](https://github.com/onflow/flow-emulator/issues/515)
- [Transaction execution fails](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/5068)
  - [Fix the setup process](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5069)
- [Add EVM transactions to FVM benchmark tests](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/5061)

Atree register inlining
- Run migration program modified to use atree inlining. Inlined checkpoint file is 215GB (was 348GB).  Also, tests indicate that using inlined checkpoint file as input can reduce future migration durations and peak RAM use. Need to test on larger vm with more RAM to confirm durations, etc.
- [Add feature to support mutation of primitive values returned by iterators](https://github.com/onflow/atree/issues/356)
- [Handle edge cases needed to support mutation of inlined maps and arrays during iteration](https://github.com/onflow/atree/issues/356)
