# Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

* We have another spork operator - Janez has done his first Testnet Spork
* Successful Cadence Language Design Meeting (LDM) on Tue.
  * We accepted 5 FLIPs ([134](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134), [210](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/210), [197](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/197), [212](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/212), [131](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131)) - This means ALL open FLIP for Cadence 1.0 are closed now.
  * We made a decision about an issue with Attachments gaining elevated permissions on the base resource through entitlements (see notes [here](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/master/meetings/2023-10-24.md)) - this will be final FLIP to be opened for Cadence 1.0, no more features / improvements are in the pipeline.
  * Really good community presence helped us make decisions quickly (we had .find, IncrementFi, Flowty, BlueSign ...).
* Cadence - fixed and deployed critical security issue (MN23 HCU 4 on Oct 26).
* Execution data indexing live on all (FF) testnet ANs, script execution on one (Peter)
* 15 Access PRs from community teams merged into flow-go in the last 4 months (Peter)
* Coinbase successfully running Rosetta against testnet 48 spork (Misha)

### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (10/3 to 10/16)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalization | 99.9%  |    100%       |       0%          |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.781%    |       219%        |

| Access API Liveness     | 99.9%  |    99.817%    |       183%        |

#### Incidents
- 15 Consensus nodes run by an operator were reset to the start of the spork and fell behind.
  - Flow mainnet is now in the Epoch fallback mode.
- Public access nodes became inaccessible due to a DNS change by the operator.

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*

### **Consensus (Dynamic Protocol State) - Alex H**

**Done last sprint**
- Finished structural changes to the `EpochSetup` participants. Refactored utility methods for flow identities to be generic. [PR](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/4726).
- Updated how protocol state keeps track of active identities of each epoch. In the model we clearly separate identities that are allowed to participate in given epoch by a new storage model. [PR](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/4834)
- Prepared [PR](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/pull/4868) for including protocol state ID in each block payload which guarantees that replicas can properly validate block and included service events.
- Creating a FLIP for Smart-contract-specified Epoch switchover timing (approved+merged)

**Ongoing** (last & next sprint)

- Wrapping up safety and consistency proofs
- Consolidating exploratory research documents to reflect final design
- Refactoring and refining the interfaces and data structures for clarity (ðŸ‘‰ [epic #4649](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/4649))
- Handle high priority [TODOs](https://github.com/onflow/flow-go/issues/4649), specifically: change how protocol state behaves in case of invalid state transition and replace dynamic weight with participation status.
