# Team Wins ðŸŽ‰

- We have another spork operator - Janez has done his first Testnet Spork
- Successful Cadence Language Design Meeting (LDM) on Tue.
  - We accepted 5 FLIPs ([134](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/134), [210](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/210), [197](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/197), [212](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/212), [131](https://github.com/onflow/flips/pull/131)) - This means ALL open FLIP for Cadence 1.0 are closed now.
  - We made a decision about an issue with Attachments gaining elevated permissions on the base resource through entitlements (see notes [here](https://github.com/onflow/cadence/blob/master/meetings/2023-10-24.md)) - this will be final FLIP to be opened for Cadence 1.0, no more features / improvements are in the pipeline.
  - Really good community presence helped us make decisions quickly (we had .find, IncrementFi, Flowty, BlueSign ...).
- Cadence - fixed and deployed critical security issue (MN23 HCU 4 on Oct 26).

### Mainnet Uptime SLO - Last 14 days (10/3 to 10/16)

|                         | Target | Current Score | Error budget used |
|:------------------------|:------:|:-------------:|:-----------------:|
| Collection Finalization | 99.9%  |    100%       |       0%          |
| Block Finalization      | 99.9%  |    99.781%    |       219%        |
| Transaction Execution   | 99.9%  |    99.846%    |       154%        |
| Block Sealing           | 99.9%  |    99.691%    |       309%        |
| Access API Liveness     | 99.9%  |    99.817%    |       183%        |

#### Incidents
- 15 Consensus nodes run by an operator were reset to the start of the spork and fell behind.
  - Flow mainnet is now in the Epoch fallback mode.
- Public access nodes became inaccessible due to a DNS change by the operator.

*99.9% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~20m8s for a 14-day window.*

*99% translates to a maximum allowed downtime of ~3hr20min for a 14-day window.*
