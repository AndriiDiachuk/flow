# Agenda for Flow Protocol Product Sync, Friday, December 1

* Update Dynamic Protocol State:
   - will complete implementation of core logic within next 2 weeks (Milestone M3)
   - next:
     - Integration testing (Milestone M4)
     - finalizing first mature version for mainnet deployment  (Milestone M5)

  Dynamic Protocol State includes **breaking changes** (data base layout), i.e. must be deployed during Network Upgrade (formerly Spork)

  - important Go/No-Go item for next Network Upgrade
  - marketing initiative desired? Extend? 

  **Next evolution step**
   - leaving Epoch Fallback Mode [EFM] _without_ spork
     -  exploratory work required for design
     -  implementation scope largely still unknown
   - target deployment _after_ Q1 2024 Upgrade
 
* Update: Automatic AN slot addition going live next week.
