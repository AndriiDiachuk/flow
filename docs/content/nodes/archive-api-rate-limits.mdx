title: Flow Archive Access API rate limits on Dapper Labs Archive nodes
---

#### Rate limits

Following are the current rate limits for the [Archive Access Node gRPC API](archive-access-api) in total across all Dapper Labs archive nodes. The actual limits are enforced by each individual node. If you are using a load balanced endpoint, the limits below are the max rate, and may vary depending on how your requests are routed.

Once the limit has reached, the client will receive an RPC error `ResourceExhausted` in the gRPC response.

Please note, these limits only apply to the archive nodes hosted by Dapper Labs. Archive nodes run by other node operators will have different rate limits.

##### Mainnet

|                 gRPC API                             | Total request per second per client IP        |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------:|
| flow.access.AccessAPI/GetAccountAtBlockHeight        |                   1                           |
| flow.access.AccessAPI/ExecuteScriptAtBlockID         |                   1                           |
| flow.access.AccessAPI/ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight     |                   1                           |


##### Testnet and Sandboxnet

|                 gRPC API                             | Total request per second per IP               |
|:-----------------------------------------------------|:---------------------------------------------:|
| flow.access.AccessAPI/GetAccountAtLatestBlock        |                   1                           |
| flow.access.AccessAPI/ExecuteScriptAtBlockID         |                   1                           |
| flow.access.AccessAPI/ExecuteScriptAtBlockHeight     |                   1                           |

_The rate limits are the same for the gRPC web interface_

_The rate limits for ALL the REST API is **40** request per second per client IP_

Please note: The rate limits are applied by each of the archive nodes behind a load balancer and limits listed here are the aggregate total from all the archive nodes. Actual limits may be somewhat less depending on how the requests are routed.
